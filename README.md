Gunners
Gunners is a website dedicated to Arsenal Football Club. It is essentially a hub for the r/gunners subreddit.

UX
As I mentioned, I designed this site to be a hub for r/gunners.

Reddit can be confusing if you're not a regular user- it can be hard to find the type of content that interests you. I've recommended certain subreddits to my friends, but they have struggled with the navigation of the website.

The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between the subreddit's community and the wider Arsenal-supporting community by showcasing some of it's top content and providing links to certain parts of reddit which user's may be interested in.

This website isn't exclusively a hub for r/gunners however, as there are a number of other pages which provide information about various aspects around the club.

Design
I choose to use a simple color scheme of Red, White & Grey. Red & White are the main colors of Arsenal, so naturally these colours are a big part of the design in this project. The grey parts of the website exist to give the website it's own identity. Couple with the font choice, I tried to go for something 'very Arsenal' but quite sleek at the same time.

User Stories:
As an Arsenal fan, I want to have everything I need to know about the club all in the same place.
I'd like a browser homepage that relates to my interest in Arsenal and gives me a shortcut to useful info such as upcoming fixtures.
I'm not necessarily a reddit user, however I enjoy some content especially in regards to Arsenal; I'd like to have a streamlined version of r/gunners with which I can easily find some of the more significant posts.
I am a reddit user, and also an Arsenal fan. Reddit can be overwhelming & distracting sometimes; I'd like a shortcut to my favorite subreddit so I don't end up spending more time on the site/app than I plan to.
Features
Existing Features:
Homepage - Acts as a streamlined r/gunners. Contains embedded posts from reddit and an embedded widget with the entire subreddit.
Homepage links - Contains non-embedded links to other subreddits, and a link for non-users to sign up and join reddit.
Fixtures page - Contains a list of upcoming fixtures for the 20/21 season.
Squad page - Contains a list of players in the current squad.
Official Footer - Contains links to the clubs official channels (Website, Social media), as well as links to official merchandising.
Our Friends page - Contains links to other Arsenal fan projects, such as AFTV and Arseblog.
Scrapped Features:
Official page - Contains links to the clubs official channels (Website, Social media), as well as links to official merchandising. Felt archaic; decided to replace it with a footer on every page which serves the same purpose.
Features Left to Implement
News / Transfers - In the future i'd like to implement a regularly updated news / transfers page.
