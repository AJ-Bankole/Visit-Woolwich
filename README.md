# Visit Woolwich
Visit Woolwich is a website with the goal of promoting tourism to my local area, Woolwich, London. This website serves as somewhat of an introduction to the area, showing a few areas of interest & helping users plan their first visit.

# UX
I've seen a few 'visit' websites that are usually based around ideal holiday locations. Since I've never been on holiday & thus never had the chance to use one of these websites, I thought i'd try and make one for the area which I have spent the majority of my life in.

# User Stories

* I'm visiting Woolwich but I don't have a clue about where to start. I'd like to be guided by a local as I visit this part of London.

* I'm an avid cyclist who would like to try something/somewhere new.

* I'm interested in historical locations but I have no idea where to start in such a seemingly ultra-modern area.

* I'd like to know what there is to do in Woolwich, perhaps with family or friends- depending on the activies available.


# Owner Goals

* I would like to introduce people to the cultural melting pot that is Woolwich.

* There is a lot of well-documented history in this area dating back centuries; I would like to bring more awareness to the rich history of Woolwich.

* I like to cycle in this area & I want to sell bicycle tours, during which I can show off the things I like about Woolwich.



## Features

Complete:

* 'Things to do' page- huge amount of room for improvement but currently the only page that serves a purpose.
* Home Page was fleshed out with more content- I tried to get my point across of what i'm actually trying to do.
* I made an interactive map with map marker that bring up information; I feel like I could have added more to this however.


Incomplete

* Accomodation page- Very plain, could do with some more map integration. I found myself at somewhat of a loss because I couldn't find anymore big hotels in woolwich.
* Cycling tours page- I spent a lot of time trying to make this work, however I just couldn't realise my idea of making interactive route maps. In the end I decided to get rid of the feature entirely because there was much to see.


## Technologies used:

*HTML - Structure
*CSS - Minimal, I believe there is only 1 rule used
*Bootstrap 4.1.3 - Used for a vast majority of the styling
*Google Maps API - Used to embed a map on my site with interactive markers. I used a lot of Google's pre-buiit code in order to get the feature working.


## Testing

A large portion of my issues came from the Google Maps API- I kept running into slight issues with specificity which built up to the point where I decided it was in my best interest to scrap a key feature. Specifically, I had a hard time trying to create a 2nd individual map element- not matter what I tried I kept making things worse so in the end I decided to accept defeat.

To be honest, this entire project is quite underwhelming in my opinion, simply because of the unnecessarily poor circumstance I initially put myself in.
