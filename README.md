# Visit Woolwich
Visit Woolwich is a website with the goal of promoting tourism to my local area, Woolwich, London. This website serves as somewhat of an introduction to the area, showing a few areas of interest & helping users plan their first visit.

# UX
I've seen a few 'visit' websites that are usually based around ideal holiday locations. Since I've never been on holiday & thus never had the chance to use one of these websites, I thought i'd try and make one for the area which I have spent the majority of my life in.

# User Stories

* I'm visiting Woolwich but I don't have a clue about where to start. I'd like to be guided by a local as I visit this part of London.

* I'm an avid cyclist who would like to try something/somewhere new.

* I'm interested in historical locations but I have no idea where to start in such a seemingly ultra-modern area.

* I'd like to know what there is to do in Woolwich, perhaps with family or friends- depending on the activies available.


# Owner Goals

* I would like to introduce people to the cultural melting pot that is Woolwich.

* There is a lot of well-documented history in this area dating back centuries; I would like to bring more awareness to the rich history of Woolwich.

* I like to cycle in this area & I want to sell bicycle tours, during which I can show off the things I like about Woolwich.



## Features

Complete:

* 'Things to do' page- huge amount of room for improvement but currently the only page that serves a purpose.

Incomplete

* Home / Index page- missing content after hero-carousel.
* Map- Map is initialised but missing content.
* Accomodation page- Very plain, could do with some more map integration.
* Cycling tours page- Hasn't been started yet.


## Technologies used:

*HTML - Structure
*CSS - Minimal, I believe there is only 1 rule used
*Bootstrap 4.1.3 - Used for a vast majority of the styling
*Google Maps API - Used to embed a map on my site, incomplete usage.


## Testing

Unfortunately i've had a myraid of issues in my personal life & I haven't been able to focus on this course very much. I hate to submit such an incomplete
project; I will absolutely need to resubmit this assignment.
